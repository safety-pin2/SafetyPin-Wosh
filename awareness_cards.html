  <q>The term 'Doxing' or 'Doxxing' is short for "dropping dox" 'dox' 
      being slang for documents. Typically, doxing is a malicious act</q>
</div>

<div class="theSlides">
    <q>The kind of information that gathered can include full name, 
        exact location, IP address, phone number, height, family members, work place, etc..</q>
</div>

<div class="theSlides">
  <q>There have been stories about public figures being cyber-bullied, 
      threatened, and doxxed, but that doesn’t mean that everyday civilians aren’t 
      having their personal information gathered and released to various sites on the internet.</q>

        <p>Examples of doxing </p>
        <p>The most common doxing situations tend to fall into these three categories: </p>
        <li>Releasing an individual's private, personally identifying information online.</li>
        <li>Revealing previously unknown information of a private person online</li>
        <li>Releasing information of a private person online could be damaging 
            to their reputation and those of their personal and/or professional associates</li>

        <p>There are steps you can take to protect your information. These include: </p>
        <p>Don’t overshare:
            <li>Don’t overshare on social media or online forums and message boards. 
                Sharing personal information could easily give doxers too much to work with.</li>
         </p>
         <p>Change your privacy settings: 
             <li>Make your posts on social media sites private so that only select people can view them.</li>
        </p>
        <p>Protecting your IP address by using a VPN.
            <li>A <a href="https://surfshark.com/learn/what-is-vpn">Virtual private network(VPN)</a> offers excellent protection against exposing IP addresses.
             A VPN takes the user's internet traffic, encrypts it, and sends it through one of the service's 
             servers before heading out to the public internet – allowing you to browse the internet anonymously.  
            </li></p>
        <p>Practice good cybersecurity.
            <li><a href="https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/antivirus">Anti-virus</a> and malware 
                detection software can stop doxers from stealing information through malicious applications. 
                Regularly updated software helps to prevent any security 'holes' that could lead to you being hacked and doxed.
            </li></p>
        <p>Use strong passwords.
            <li>A strong password normally includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, plus numbers and symbols. 
            Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, and make sure you change your passwords regularly. 
            If you have problems remembering passwords, try using a password manager.</li>
        </p>Set up Google alerts.
        <li>You can set up Google alerts for your full name, phone number, home address, or other private data 
            you are concerned about so you know if it suddenly appears online, it may mean you have been doxed.</li> 
        </p>
        <p>Ask Google to remove information.
            <li>If personal information appears in Google search results, 
                individuals can request its removal from the search engine. Google makes this a simple process through an online form. 
                Many data brokers put this type of data online, usually for background checks or crime check information.</li>

        <p>What to do if you become a doxing victim: </p>
        <p>Report it. <li>Report the attack to the platforms on which your personal information has been posted. 
            Search the relevant platform's terms of service or community guidelines to determine their reporting process for this type of attack and follow it.
            While filling a form out once, save it for the future (so you do not have to repeat yourself). 
            This is the first step to stop the spread of your personal information</li> </p>
        <p>Involve law enforcement. <li>If a doxer makes personal threats against you, 
            contact your local police department. Any information pointing to your home address or financial information should be treated as a top priority, 
            especially if there are credible threats attached.</li> </p>
        <p>Protect your financial accounts. <li>If doxers have published your bank account or credit card numbers, 
            report this immediately to your financial institutions(s). Your credit card provider will likely cancel your card and send you a new one. 
            You will also need to change the passwords for your online bank and credit card accounts.</li> </p>
